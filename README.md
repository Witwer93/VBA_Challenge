# VBA_Challenge

The task was to:
	Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.
	The ticker symbol.
	Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
	The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
	The total stock volume of the stock.
	You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Then add the greatest % Increase/decrease and total volume as well as their corresponding tickers

Then make it work on all of the worksheets.

We were also supposed to practice with git add/commit/push to the repository we made specifically for this project.

In the end we were asked to shoot for 20+ commits and provide screenshots of what our vba script produced in the larger stock file.

Screenshots of the finished product (file after running vba subroutine) will be included in the repository.
