# VBA_Challenge

The task was to:
	Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.
	The ticker symbol.
	Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
	The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
	The total stock volume of the stock.
	You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Then add the greatest % Increase/decrease and total volume as well as their corresponding tickers

Then make it work on all of the worksheets.

We were also supposed to practice with git add/commit/push to the repository we made specifically for this project.

in the end we were asked to shoot for 20+ commits and provide screenshots of what our vba script produced in the larger stock file.

I actually enjoyed coding out the loop that read through the data and recorded the useful stuff, and I didn't find it particularly challening.
However I ran into several issues with committing changes to github, though I did end up solving that problem.
I also ran into issues with excel becoming unresponsive while running my code. I don't know how typical this is, and wonder if it's
just that my laptop isn't particularly powerful though it does meet the requirements for class.

It's entirely possible that I will have to upload a slightly unfinished product in order to make the deadline, because I did not anticipate 
having so many problems with excel as well as the surprisingly long runtimes.

(11:55pm) I will have to submit the link to my repository before I've finished the (hopefully) last run of my vba code
the initial submission will be missing the screenshots, but the code should be working.
I really overesitmated how long it would take to run my code on the larger stock file.
